Basic Maven Commands
---------------------------------------------
1. mvn clean

	Deletes the target/ directory (removes old build files).

	mvn clean

2. mvn compile

	Compiles the source code of the project.

	mvn compile

3. mvn test

	Runs unit tests using a testing framework (like JUnit).

	mvn test

4. mvn package

	Compiles code, runs tests, and packages the project (JAR/WAR).

	mvn package

5. mvn install

	Packages the project and installs it into the local repository.

	mvn install

6. mvn deploy

	Deploys the packaged project to a remote repository.

	mvn deploy

Project Setup Commands
7. mvn archetype:generate

	Creates a new Maven project from a template.

	mvn archetype:generate

8. mvn validate

	Checks whether the project structure is correct.

	mvn validate

Dependency & Info Commands
9. mvn dependency:tree

	Displays the project dependency tree.

	mvn dependency:tree

10. mvn dependency:list

Lists all project dependencies.

mvn dependency:list

11. mvn help:effective-pom

	Shows the final POM after inheritance and defaults.

	mvn help:effective-pom

Clean + Build Combined
12. mvn clean install

	Cleans old build files and installs the new build.

	mvn clean install

Common Maven Lifecycles

Clean → clean

Default (Build) → compile, test, package, install, deploy

Site → site

Interview Tip

Most commonly used in real projects:

mvn clean
mvn compile
mvn test
mvn package
mvn install


What is Maven?

Apache Maven is a build automation and project management tool, mainly used for Java projects.

It helps developers to:

Build projects (compile, test, package, deploy)

Manage dependencies (JAR files and libraries)

Maintain a standard project structure

Automate the build lifecycle

Maven uses a configuration file called pom.xml (POM = Project Object Model) where:

Project details are defined

Dependencies are listed

Plugins are configured

Example:

	mvn clean install


This single command cleans, builds, tests, and installs the project.

Key Features of Maven

	a) Dependency management (automatic download from repositories)

	b) Standard directory structure

	c) Lifecycle-based build system

	d) Plugin-based architecture

	e) Strong community support

Alternatives to Maven
1. Gradle

✅ Most popular alternative

Uses Groovy or Kotlin DSL

Faster builds (incremental builds & caching)

More flexible and less verbose than Maven

Used by Spring Boot and Android

📌 Build file: build.gradle

2. Ant

Older build tool

XML-based (like Maven but more manual)

No built-in dependency management

Requires custom scripting

📌 Build file: build.xml

3. Ivy

Dependency management tool

Often used with Ant

Less popular today

4. Bazel

Developed by Google

Very fast and scalable

Used for large, complex projects

Language-agnostic

5. SBT (Scala Build Tool)

Mainly for Scala projects

Interactive build tool

Supports incremental compilation

Comparison Table
	Feature				Maven			Gradle				Ant
	Configuration		XML (pom.xml)	Groovy/Kotlin DSL	XML
	Dependency Mgmt		Yes				Yes					No
	Build Speed			Moderate		Fast				Slow
	Flexibility			Medium			High				High
	Popularity			Very High		Very High			Low
	
Which One Should You Use?

Maven → Stable, standard, easy to learn

Gradle → Faster, modern, flexible

Ant → Legacy projects

Bazel → Large-scale systems

Interview One-Liner

Maven is a build automation and dependency management tool for Java projects; Gradle and Ant are its main alternatives.
